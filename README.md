# Matrix Multiplication Program

This Java program performs matrix multiplication based on user input or command line arguments. It supports two modes of operation:

1. File Input Mode: Provide two file names as command line arguments, or input them when prompted. The program reads two matrices from the specified files, multiplies them, and saves the result to a file named `matrix3.txt`.

2. Integer Input Mode: Provide an integer as a command line argument, or input it when prompted. The program generates two random square matrices with the specified size, saves them to files `matrix1.txt` and `matrix2.txt`, performs matrix multiplication, and saves the result to `matrix3.txt`.

# How to Use
